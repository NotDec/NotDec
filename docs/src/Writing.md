**Motivation of this project**

1. Existing decompiler only offer as a whole part, however, the decompilation algorithm can be useful to boost the scalability and precision of existing binary analysis techniques.

1. Most existing work focus on the low level analysis, with the [advance of decompiler][1], we can utilize existing source-level analysis and extend them to support binary.
